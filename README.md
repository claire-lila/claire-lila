I tried
 - convolutional layers Learn 40 filters using a 3x3 kernel
   　→　convolutional layers Learn 100 filters using a 3x3 kernel
   as I increased the number of filters, the output became more accurate
   
 - Max pooling with 2x2 kernels
   　→　Max pooling with 3x3 kernels
   the outpput became less accurate
   
 - 10 hidden layers with ReLU activation
  　→ 100 hidden layers with ReLU activation
   the output became more accurate
